## Usage

The site is fairly straightforward. Users are allowed to input transactions, which get logged in the `LEDGER` and added to the `CHART`. As an additional level of functionality, Budget Buddy will allow a user to work off-line. Any transactions that are entered, while off-line, will be stored `LOCALLY`. Once Budget Buddy detects that the user is back on-line, the stored transactions will be sent to the database and stored on a more permanent basis.
